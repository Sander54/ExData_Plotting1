## Introduction

This assignment uses data from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Individual household
electric power consumption Data Set" which I have made available on
the course web site:


* <b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]

* <b>Description</b>: Measurements of electric power consumption in
one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost
4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values
are available.

S Hendriks has pushed 4 codes(and 4 graphs in PNG-format):

If you start the first code (Plot1.R) the data will be loaded, unzipped and read in R
The first R-code will also result in an Graph
Starting the second r-code will show an second Graph based on the data already "loaded&Read" in R 
Idem the 3th code and the 4th.

Unfortunately Sander wasnot able to show the day of the week in the x-axis
His laptop did not allowed to change the variable date in European style in US style
